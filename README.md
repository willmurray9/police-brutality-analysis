# police-brutality-analysis

**Context**

This PowerPoint is the last project that I worked on in my Conveying Visual Data Insights course. I took this course in the Spring of 2021, and so far it is my favorite course that I have taken while at Notre Dame. I thoroughly enjoyed using a combination of my analytical skills and creativity to turn data sets into powerful visualizations. In fact, this course is one of the reasons that I initially grew interested in pursuing a career in data science. 

This project in particular deals with a data set containing information on police shootings over the past few years. As students, we were given total freedom to take our work in any direction we desired, but our professor stressed the importance of not letting any of our biases impact our analysis. As you will see in my presentation, many of the relationships and takeaways that I found are similar to stories you hear in the media. At the same time, I tried to find some less commonly represented statistics so that my audience could gain a broader, unbiased understanding of police shootings. Hopefully you enjoy viewing my visualizations as much as I enjoyed creating them!
